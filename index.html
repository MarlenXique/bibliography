<h3> So like.. <em>How does veganism help anyone?</em> A question that you've probably heard once or twice. Well in this site, You'll finally get answered!
</h3>
    <p>First of all..what is a vegan? A vegan is a person who does not eat any food derived from animals and  does not use other animal products. While a vegetarian is someone who just doesn't eat meat (but can use or wear products that come from animals. Sometimes people choose not to eat meat because of religious purposes, doctor's orders, or sometimes for a challenge. I became vegetarian because of mental health reasons. But the truth is that there is so much reasons. In this site you can click on the navigation bar on top to see why you should at least try to become a vegetarian!</p>
