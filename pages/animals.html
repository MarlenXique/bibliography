<h3>Farm to Fridge</h3>
    <p>
    In this short document they expose the truth behind the farms and places where they keep animals. They show the true reality of how animals get treated before getting slaughtered. Male chicks and baby pigs get smothered in trash bags and left to die. Female chickens are forced to stay in a cage way too small for them to lay eggs. Baby cows are taken away from their mother to give us milk and then get rid of their horns with no anesthetic. just imagine the pain behind that. Animals also include sea animals. A lot of people forget fish can feel. Fish get skinned alive and when a dolphin or any other sea animals is trapped in a net that was meant for edible fish they get killed instead of being let go. These animals are just as smart and capable of feeling as any dog, cat or hamster. So why would we treat them the way we do?</p>
