<h3>Cowspiracy (On Netflix)</h3>
    <p>
    In the netflix documentary â€œCowspiracy: The sustainability secret, directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn; They talk about the damaging reality of consuming means. Eating meat is dangerously bad for our planet. it's surprising knowing that not enough people are talking about it. But how could they? Not only did they reveal the truth of how much water is used in one pound of beef (one pound of beef uses 2,500 gallons of water!!) but they also talk about how the government and climate activists, people who are meant to help reduce climate change. Hide this information. Not enough people are addressing this situation because there used to be very limited information. There's also one quote from the documentary that kept me up at night "The meat and dairy industry produces more greenhouse gases than the exhaust of all cars, trucks, trains, boats, planes combined." Not only that but these industries produce methane- it's 86 times more destructive than carbon dioxide from vehicles. Just imagine the amount of destruction that these industries have, for meat.
