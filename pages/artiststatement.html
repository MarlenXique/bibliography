<h3>My Artist Statement</h3>
    <p>
    I became interested in this topic because I myself am a vegetarian. I've been for about three years. In the beginning I did inform myself and study the pros and cons of becoming a vegan. But three years later I have forgotten why and the importance of being vegetarian. I understand it's not for everyone and I know not everyone is gonna like this topic but i think it's important to let people know why it would be a great idea to change. I was inspired to specifically make a website because in the film “Cowspiracy'' Kip Andersen mentioned how Climate Activist sites don't have any information about the amount of damage that meat actually has. And this semester I was introduced to html and css, so it fit perfectly. This is also my first site that I’ve ever made publicly. My intended audience is people around my age. This is another reason why I made a website. I know I go through around 20 sites a day for either information or entertainment, and I think my audience does too. So my website would be perfect for searching up information and finding links about this topic. I choose my intended audience because we’ll be here for the long run. We can make change happen. Also we’re the ones worried about climate change. And if anything then maybe younger ones will find this website and get inspired to change. That’s why a website is the best way to communicate my ideas (or anything really) because it stays on the internet, something that my intended audience knows how to use. </p>
<h3>How did it go?</h3>

    Definitely felt a lot of emotions while creating this website. At first I was feeling laid back and thought everything would run smoothly because I’ve done everything- separately. (Because i was introduced to html and css this semester, that meant that i was taught everything in lessons.) So when i had to make one website using everything i learned..it was a bit stressful at times.  But there were times of relief and excitement when I debugged some code and managed to make everything look good too. There were a lot of stages to this site. My plan, color schemes, photos, banner, changed about five times. But I also have some experience in photoshop so it wasn't too difficult. What I would've done differently is add a navigation bar that could move as you scroll for convenience and to make my site look color. I would also add more pages and reasons to change. I also don't like that my banner doesn't move with the size of the window. But other than that i liked how this site turned out.
