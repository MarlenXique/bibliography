<h3>Mental health and vegetarianism/veganism</h3>
    <P>
    Mental health is super important, because it affects how we think, feel, and act. Mental health helps us think and determine how we're going to handle stressful situations. So we should take care of it. Have you ever heard that saying “You are what you eat?” Well it turns out that if you eat meat full of Arachidonic acid and hormones. You probably don't feel your best. At least if you eat an unnecessary amount. Arachidonic acid is good in any stable diet but chicken and eggs specifically have a really high level of it and produce Inflammatory compounds that could affect your brain negatively. It’s also proven that vegans and vegetarians showed fewer symptoms of depressions, anxiety, stress, and mood disturbance. (Doesnt means there's a zero percent chance...it's just lower.) Food affects your mental health, not eating meat affects it positively, So why not try it?
